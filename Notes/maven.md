# Maven
Maven is a dependency manager and build automation tool for Java programs. Maven project configuration and dependencies are handled using the Project Object Model, which is defined in a file called the `pom.xml` file. This file contains information about the project, including project dependencies and various Maven plugins.

- `<properties>`: where we will put various project-specific settings
- `<dependencies>`: where we will put Java dependencies that we want to use.
