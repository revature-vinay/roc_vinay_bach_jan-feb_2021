# Java Study Guide

## Fundamentals
- Features, benefits, and drawbacks of Java language
    - WORA (write once, run anywhere)
        - We are compiling to bytecode
        - bytecode can then be run by the JVM for that specific operating system
    - Backed by Oracle
    - Rich APIs (e.g. Collections API)
    - Object-oriented
    - Strongly/strictly typed
    - High level (e.g. we don't need to handle memory allocation ourselves, there is automatic garbage collection)
        - and the syntax is a lot easier to read and write than something like binary 0s and 1s or assembly code
    - Verbose
- POJOs vs Bean
- Stack vs Heap
    - Heap is where objects are stored
    - We also have a special string pool for String literals
    - The stack is where variables local to a method
- Purpose and contents of the JDK, JRE, and JVM
- Garbage collection
- main method signature and significance
- compiling and executing Java code on the command line
    - javac SomeFile.java
    - java SomeFile
- Primitive Data types
    - boolean
    - byte
    - char
    - short
    - int
    - long
    - float
    - double
- Operators
    - Arithmetic
        - pre/post-increment
    - logical 
    - ternary <- look into these, they're pretty cool
- Scopes of variables
    - static
    - instance
    - method
    - block
- Control flow statements
    - for
    - enhanced for loop
    - if/else
    - while
    - do-while
    - switch
- Class members
    - Fields (instance/static variables)
    - Methods (instance/static)
    - Constructors
    - Nested classes (advanced)
- Access Modifiers
    - public
    - protected
    - default
    - private
- Nonaccess modifiers
    - static
    - final
    - abstract
- Packages and imports
    - what packages are for
    - why we need to import classes
    - static imports
- this and super keywords
- JRE library classes
    - Object class
        - equals() method
        - hashCode() method
        - toString() method
    - System (System.out.println), (System.in)
    - String
    - StringBuilder
    - StringBuffer
    - Collections (utility class)
    - Arrays (utility class)
        - Arrays.toString(arr) to print out elements from the array
    - Wrapper classes
        - Autoboxing / unboxing - primitive to wrapper / wrapper to primitive conversion
- Varargs

## OOP
- OOP principles
    - Abstraction
        - Abstract classes
        - Interfaces
    - Polymorphism
        - Method Overloading (compile-time polymorphism)
        - Method Overriding (runtime polymorphism)
            - Covariant return types
            - Access levels
    - Inheritance
        - Inheriting from classes vs interfaces
    - Encapsulation
        - Using access modifiers with getters/setters
- Object v. Class
    - class is the blueprint
    - an object is constructed from this blueprint
- Abstract classes
    - difference between abstract and concrete classes
- Interfaces
    - implicit modifiers for variables and methods
    - When to use interfaces instead of abstract classes
        - For example we can implement multiple interfaces
        - but we can only extend one class (including abstract classes)

## Collections
- Collections API
    - Inheritance hierarchy
    - List, Set, Map, and Queue interfaces and some of the differences between these data structures
    - Concrete implementations and their differences
        - HashMap v TreeMap
        - HashSet v. TreeSet
        - ArrayList v. LinkedList
    - Using enhanced for loops
    - Iterator

## Annotations
- @Override
- @Deprecated
- @SuppressWarnings
- etc.

## Generics
- Know about the concept of generics

## Exceptions
- Know the class hierarchy
    - Throwable
        - Error
        - Exception
            - RuntimeException
                - unchecked exceptions
            - checked exceptions
- Handling or declaring exceptions
    - throw v. throws
- try/catch/finally blocks
    - rules for multiple catch blocks
        - most specific exceptions go first
    - finally is optional
- Creating custom exceptions
    - extends Exception v. extends RuntimeException
